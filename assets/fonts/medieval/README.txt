MEDIEVAL FONT PLACEHOLDER

The current medieval_font.ttf file is a placeholder and not a valid font file, which is causing "FreeType: Error loading font" errors.

To fix this issue, please download a proper medieval-style font (such as "Cloister Black", "Old English Text MT", or "Blackletter") and replace the medieval_font.ttf file with it.

Make sure to:
1. Rename the downloaded font to "medieval_font.ttf"
2. Place it in this directory (HortusConclusis/assets/fonts/medieval/)
3. Restart Godot to reload the font resources

Alternatively, you can modify the project to use a different font that's already installed on your system.
