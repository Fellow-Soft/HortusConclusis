Illuminated Manuscript Border Assets

These border elements are designed to enhance the aesthetic of the Hortus Conclusus title screen,
giving it the appearance of a medieval illuminated manuscript.

In a production environment, these assets would be generated using the border_generator_tool.gd
script, which uses procedural generation to create various border styles including:

1. Corner flourishes - Ornate spiral designs for the corners of the manuscript
2. Sacred geometry patterns - Based on medieval geometric art principles
3. Vine borders - Organic vine and leaf motifs common in manuscript illumination

To generate these assets, run the border_generator_tool.gd script from the Godot editor.
